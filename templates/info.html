        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Real-time sensor data is analyzed, including temperature, speed and torque.</li>
            <li><strong>Machine Learning Models:</strong> Algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM are compared for accuracy and selected the highest accuracy model.</li>
            <li><strong>Crayfish Optimization:</strong> A nature-inspired algorithm that enhances model performance and prediction accuracy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The model is trained on machine_failure dataset consisting 10000 data points stored in 14 features. The model selected the four best features from the all and predicted the result based on their real time values. The Final model with optimization has <b style="color: black;">accuracy of 97%.</b>
